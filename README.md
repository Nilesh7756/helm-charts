# helm-charts
Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.  Charts are created as files laid out in a particular directory tree, then they can be packaged into versioned archives to be deployed.
